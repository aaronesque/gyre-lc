# Overview

GYRE-lc is a Python library for the production of synthetic light curves for tidally distorted binary systems. It relies heavily on GYRE-tides (Sun et al., 2021), an as-yet unreleased extension of [GYRE](https://github.com/rhdtownsend/gyre) to model stellar tides. It requires at least one [MESA](https://github.com/MESAHub/mesa) stellar model and its corresponding GYRE tide model as inputs. A model spectrum is also requiredâ€“ GYRE-lc works best with [MSG](https://github.com/rhdtownsend/msg) interpolated spectra for speed, ease of use, accuracy, and reliability.
